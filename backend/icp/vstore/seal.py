"""Sealing the two key blobs to this machine, and telling the ways an unseal fails apart.

Primary path (spec section 6, gate G1): the daemon, as uid `pear-passwords`, runs

    systemd-creds --user encrypt --name=pear.<tier>.u<uid> - -

with the secret on a pipe, never in argv or a file. `--user` binds the blob to the daemon's
uid, so even another root-less process that got hold of the file cannot decrypt it.

What the key type is, and what it must never be. In uid scope systemd-creds cannot read
/var/lib/systemd/credential.secret itself, so it hands the request to the
io.systemd.Credentials varlink service - and that request has no field for PCRs or a public
key, and systemd 261 also drops --with-key on the way (checked: an explicit withKey sent
straight over varlink even turns a user-scope request into a system-scope blob that uid
scope then refuses with "Scope mismatch"). So the service always picks `auto`: the host key
today, host+TPM2 once a TPM2 is usable, with no PCRs. The one thing auto would add on its own
is a signed PCR-11 policy, when a tpm2-pcr-public-key.pem exists (a UKI setup) - and a blob
bound to it refuses to open after a boot that cannot present a matching signature (a Limine
fallback, another kernel). So:

- with a TPM present and such a PEM installed, nothing is sealed (SealUnavailable, with the
  reason): no store is created and no re-seal happens until the PEM is gone or the root seal
  service is selected (docs/security.md, G1);
- after sealing, the credential header's key type is read back (`key_type`), and that - not
  a probe - is what keys.json records; an unscoped, null, TPM-only or public-key-bound type
  is refused.

Fallback (if G1 fails in the hardened unit): a root oneshot does system-scope sealing for the
daemon over a socket (`SealServiceBackend`), where the flags do apply: it runs
`--with-key=host` or `--with-key=host+tpm2` explicitly, `--tpm2-pcrs=` and an empty
`--tpm2-public-key=`. It is selected with PEAR_SEAL_BACKEND=seal-service in the unit's
environment, which only root can set; everything above it is unchanged, so the UX states stay
the same.

A failed decrypt is told apart from a failed mechanism: only when the tool demonstrably
works (a throwaway value still round-trips) is a non-zero exit a refusal of this blob
(UnsealRefused, which becomes a seal state). A tool that cannot reach its service, a busy or
locked-out TPM, ENOMEM: SealUnavailable, transient, never a seal state.

Sealing is lazy: nothing here runs at daemon start, only at unlock, so a missing or replaced
TPM shows up as a state in the app instead of a service that will not start.
