"""The v2 per-user store: /var/lib/pear-passwords/u<uid>/, read and written only by the daemon.

This file is the frozen interface between WP2 (which implements it, in this package) and its
callers: WP1's handlers and WP3's Apple pipeline. Signatures, field names and exception kinds
here do not change without a foundation amendment on v2-base; the bodies are WP2's.

Key hierarchy (spec section 3): RK_list unlocks meta, session, aliases and nicknames through
HKDF subkeys; SK_secret opens one entry box at a time and is wiped at once. Writes only ever
need PK_secret, so sync and edits never unseal SK_secret - `unseal_count` lets a test prove it.

Rules every implementation keeps:
- A decrypt or AEAD error never deletes or rewrites anything; it surfaces as SealError("damaged").
- Every write is O_EXCL temp 0600, fsync, rename, fsync of the directory.
- Nothing here prompts, imports polkit, or reads $HOME.
- There is no sync lease: lock() wipes every key and subkey, always.
