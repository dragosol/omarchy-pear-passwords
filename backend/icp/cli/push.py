"""Push one change to iCloud: a password, an entry's details, a rename, a new entry.

An Apple Passwords entry is two records and BOTH must move, which is the lesson from the
first attempt at this: rewriting only the credential record stored the new password where we
could read it back, while every Apple device kept showing the old one out of the metadata
record's `s_hi` history blob.

Blast radius is one account. Nothing here iterates, and a record that does not decrypt to the
account we were asked to change is skipped rather than guessed at.

In 2.0 this runs inside the daemon, called by daemon/apple.py with a Zone it opened from the
user's store. Nothing here loads a session, re-enters a sync command or touches a vault file:
after a write the caller re-fetches just the zone that was written (`refetch`), checks the
change came back, and hands that one entry to the store.
