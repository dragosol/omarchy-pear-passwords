"""pear-clip: put one value on the Wayland clipboard for one paste, then take it away.

Started by the Pear window as `pear-exec clip`, with a ticket on stdin (never argv or the
environment). It redeems the ticket with the daemon for `{value, sensitive, timeout}` and owns
the regular selection through wayland.py. Spec section 4.6 and docs/protocol.md sections 7 and
10.1.

The rules, in the order a request meets them:

1. `x-kde-passwordManagerHint` (offered only for a sensitive value) is always served the word
   `secret`, which asks history managers not to keep the entry.
2. Every other request hands over a pipe. The process(es) at the other end are found in /proc,
   among this user's processes whose /proc/<pid>/fd can be read.
   - If none is found there, the request is refused: the pipe is closed unwritten, it does not
     count, and the offer stays up. That covers a pipe nobody holds any more (a history
     watcher's child that exited without reading, faster than the scan) and a reader that
     cannot be inspected: a non-dumpable process, Pear's own window first of all. The window
     is set-gid and non-dumpable, and Qt Quick reads the clipboard text itself the moment the
     selection changes (every editable TextField re-checks "can paste"); counting that read
     took the one paste before the user pasted anything. So a copied secret cannot be pasted
     into a non-dumpable program, Pear's window included, and an unidentifiable reader gets
     nothing.
   - If every holder is a known clipboard-history watcher (watchers.py), the request is
     refused the same way and does not count.
3. Any other identified reader gets the value and is the one paste - but only once the value
   was actually delivered: a write that hit EPIPE, or took no byte, is not a paste and the
   offer stays up for the real one. For CLIP_REREQUEST_GRACE_S afterwards the same set of
   holder processes may ask again (XWayland and some toolkits read twice); nobody else gets
   anything. Then the source is destroyed.
4. With no paste by `timeout` seconds the source is destroyed. Destroying a source clears the
   clipboard only if it is still the selection: a copy you made since is never touched, and
   set_selection(null) is never sent.

Gate G5 decides rule 2. If the VM shows that /proc/<pid>/fd cannot be read from this set-gid
process, the release flips READER_POLICY to "timing" (spec section 1.4, proposal 2's fallback,
explicitly weaker): nobody is identified, so rule 2's refusal of unidentified readers cannot
apply (nothing could ever be pasted). Instead the requests in the first WATCHER_WINDOW_S after
the offer goes up are taken to be the history watcher and Pear's own window (both read the
moment the selection changes) and get nothing, and the first request after that is the paste,
whoever makes it - including the window re-reading when it gets focus back. A switch in this
root-owned file, not the environment, because pear-exec passes no environment through.

The outcome goes back to the daemon (`clip-result`), which tells the window. The window also
reads this process's stdout, one JSON line per event and never the value: `{"event": "offered"}`
once the compositor has answered a sync sent after set_selection (only then does the window say
"copied"), `{"event": "error", "reason": ...}` when it ends without ever offering, and last
`{"event": "done", "outcome": ...}`. The value lives in
a bytearray that is zeroed before exit; Python may have copied it on the way in (the JSON
reply), which is why the real boundary is that this process is non-dumpable.
