"""Per-entry tags, kept as the last line of an entry's notes:

    Tags: #work #finance #side-project

Apple has no user-assigned categories that sync. Notes do, and this line shows on every Apple
device as ordinary note text, so it is the one per-entry, multi-valued category that stays in
iCloud Passwords. Pear reads it as list metadata (tier 1) and writes it only on a tag edit.

Parsing is tolerant and writing is canonical:

    tagline = [WS] "Tags" ":" WS1 tag *(WS1 tag) [WS]     "Tags" ASCII, any case
    tag     = "#" 1..32 of (Unicode L*, M*, N*, "_", "-")
    WS/WS1  = [ \\t]* / [ \\t]+

A tag cannot hold whitespace, "#", ":", a comma or a control character, so nothing ever needs
escaping. A line with one bad token, more than 16 tags or a tag over 32 characters is not a
tag line: it stays in the body as it is, and Pear never "repairs" a line it did not write. Only
the final line counts; the same text anywhere else is body text.

Every function here is pure: no I/O, no logging, nothing about who calls it.
