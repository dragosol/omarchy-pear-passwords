"""The frozen numbers, names and internal interfaces of the daemon protocol.

docs/protocol.md is the specification; this module is the same contract in code, so the daemon
(WP1), the clients (WP4) and the autofill host (WP6) import one set of values instead of each
copying them. backend/tests/test_protocol_contract.py checks the two against each other.

Nothing in here talks to a socket or to polkit. The `Connection`, `Session` and
`SessionRegistry` protocols describe what WP1's server hands to an op handler written by
another work package (today: daemon/autofill.py), so that handler can be written and tested
against fakes before the server exists.
