"""The Apple pipeline as the daemon calls it. Owned by WP3; these signatures are frozen.

Every function is blocking (network-bound) and is run by WP1 in a worker thread under the
uid's store lock. Each takes a UserContext whose store is unlocked, reads and writes the
iCloud session only through ctx.store, and asks questions only through ctx.ui - so a
background call (ctx.frontend is None) that needs a person raises NeedsLogin.

This module must never import or name the daemon's authorization module (not even in a
comment), and a sync must never unseal SK_secret: tests grep, walk the AST and count unseals.

Errors: NeedsLogin (context), Cancelled (context), icp.auth.anisette.AnisetteError for an
unreachable anisette server, and icp.errors.AppleError subclasses for everything iCloud
refuses. WP1 maps them to the error codes in docs/protocol.md. Two more are defined here:
NotSignedIn (no iCloud session, or one that never joined the keychain: `not-signed-in`) and
FieldError (a value that failed validation: `invalid` with `field`). Network failures surface
as requests.RequestException (`network`).
