"""Per-uid state, and the shared services every op handler uses (protocol.SessionRegistry).

A Session is one uid: its store, its one window connection, whether tier 1 is open on that
connection, its settings, and what is running for it. The Registry holds every session plus
the things that must be decided in exactly one place:

- authorize(): the only way any handler raises a polkit dialog. It enforces one outstanding
  dialog per (uid, bucket) and PROMPT_ANSWERED_PER_MIN refused (dismissed or denied) dialogs
  per (uid, bucket, action) per rolling minute,
  supersedes a pending `grant` with a new one, and cancels on EOF.
- lock(): every lock trigger in docs/protocol.md 4.2 ends here. It marks the uid locked first,
  then wipes the grant, revokes tickets, withdraws clip and migrate processes, cancels dialogs
  and a running sign-in, and wipes the store's keys. It never waits: it runs on the event loop,
  which serves every uid, and a store call can sit in systemd-creds for up to a minute on a
  slow TPM. When no store call is running the keys are wiped at once; when one is, the uid is
  marked wipe-after and the store is asked to wipe (UserStore.try_lock): the store method in
  progress wipes the keys the moment it returns, still under the store's mutex, and every
  store method after it is refused - also inside the same run_store call, which can be many
  store methods (a sync). New run_store calls for the uid are refused until then. Never a
  half-applied sync, never a meta.v2 sealed from a wiped doc.
- run_store(): blocking UserStore and Apple calls go to a worker thread under the uid's store
  lock, and wipe the keys again on the way out when a lock landed meanwhile.
