"""Browser autofill, daemon side: the two ops an `autofill` connection may send.

The daemon's dispatch table calls the two handlers for role "autofill" and nothing else
does. The browser extension is not part of this repository - anyone can write one against
docs/autofill-protocol.md - so the daemon trusts nothing the extension says except the origin,
and treats that only as being as trustworthy as the browser that reported it.

The rules these handlers implement (docs/protocol.md 'Autofill' is the normative text):

- Off until the user turns it on in the window (op autofill-enable, behind .manage): hello
  refuses the role, and both ops refuse with "forbidden" once it is turned off again. pear-exec
  runs the autofill role for any program of yours, so the browser manifest alone is no opt-in.
- A query names accounts (username, label) only to a connection that has had a fill approved
  since the last unlock; before that it gives handles and match kinds only. Any program of
  yours that gets one fill dialog approved receives that one password - the dialog says a
  browser extension is asking, and the window shows whether an autofill host is connected.
- An autofill client never sees an entry id. Entry ids are an unkeyed hash of (domain,
  username), so handing them out would let any program confirm a guessed username offline.
  Every reply carries a handle instead: HMAC-SHA256 of the id under a random key that exists
  only while the uid is unlocked (made by the unlock, dropped by every lock), so handles mean
  nothing after a lock and cannot be computed from a guess. A real entry id sent to fill is
  just an unknown handle (no-match).

- A locked Pear reveals nothing. Unless the uid's tier-1 UI session is unlocked, both ops
  answer as if no account exists for any site: autofill-query returns {"state": "locked"} with
  no other field, autofill-fill raises OpError("locked"). Neither ever unseals a key, raises a
  dialog, or touches the store while locked.
- The autofill role never gets a tier-1 or tier-2 grant and never uses the UI's grants. Every
  fill raises its own `.autofill` polkit dialog against the autofill process's pidfd.
- Matching is by site, never by name: the origin host must be the entry's `domain` or one of
  its `sites`, or a subdomain/parent of one at a dot boundary, within the same registrable
  domain. Name-only and inferred-alias matches (`Meta.aliases`) are never used.
