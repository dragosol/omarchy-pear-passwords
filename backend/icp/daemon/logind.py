"""Lock triggers from systemd-logind: screen lock, sleep, and the end of a user's sessions.

On the system bus the daemon listens for:

- org.freedesktop.login1.Session.Lock on any session, and PropertiesChanged with
  LockedHint=true: that session's uid is locked with reason `screen-locked`;
- Manager.PrepareForSleep(true): every uid is locked with reason `sleep` while a `delay`
  inhibitor holds the suspend back, and only then is the inhibitor released, so no key is in
  RAM or in a hibernation image. PrepareForSleep(false) takes a new inhibitor;
- Manager.SessionRemoved: when a uid's last session ends it is locked (`session-ended`).

Signals are accepted only from logind's own bus name. A forged one could at worst cause a
lock, which is harmless (gate G6). If the bus or logind is unavailable the daemon still runs;
the window then forwards Hyprland's lock as a `lock` op (G6 fallback) and EOF still locks.

The D-Bus I/O runs in a thread of its own (jeepney's threading router, which can receive the
inhibitor fd). Every action on daemon state is handed to the event loop and waited for.
