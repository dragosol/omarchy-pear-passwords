"""Who is on the other end of an accepted connection, checked before a single byte is read.

The socket is 0660 pear-passwords:pear-client and the group has no members, so the kernel
already refuses anyone whose effective gid is not pear-client. These checks are the second
layer (docs/protocol.md 2.1): they read the kernel's own record of the peer and refuse a
connection the filesystem should never have let through.

1. SO_PEERCRED: the peer's gid at connect() is pear-client and its uid is a normal user.
2. SO_PEERPIDFD (77): a pidfd for exactly that process, held for the life of the connection.
   It is the polkit subject, so a recycled pid can never be asked about.
3. /proc/<pid>/status: real gid is the user's own, effective gid is pear-client (the set-gid
   exec of pear-exec and nothing else produces that pair), and real = effective uid.
   /proc/<pid>/stat gives the start time for PPid binding and the polkit fallback subject.
   Last, a signal 0 down the pidfd proves the pid read from /proc was still that process.

Nothing here trusts a value the client sent; a client sends nothing until all of it passed.
