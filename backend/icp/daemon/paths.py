"""Every system path, name and polkit action id Pear Passwords 2 uses, in one place.

The installer (system/install-root.sh), pear-exec (native/pear-exec.c) and the daemon must agree
on all of these. The shell side reads system/paths.env; this module is the Python side, and
backend/tests/test_paths_agree.py fails if the two ever differ. pear-exec.c hard-codes its
values and is checked against paths.env by WP4's test.

Nothing here touches the filesystem. Per-user paths in $HOME (browser manifests, the v1 vault)
are deliberately not here: they belong to the code that runs as that user.
