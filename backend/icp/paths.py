"""Filesystem locations: the 2.0 per-user store, and the 1.x vault the migration reads.

Two worlds live here and must not be confused:

* **v2 store** - `/var/lib/pear-passwords/u<uid>/`, owned by the `pear-passwords` system user
  and written only by the daemon (icp.vstore). Nothing under $HOME decrypts anything in 2.0.
  The layout is spec section 3.2; the names below are the only place it is spelled out.
* **v1 vault** - `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/icp`, the 1.x files. In 2.0 they are only ever *read*, by
  the importer running as the user (`pear-exec migrate`), and then renamed aside. The
  passphrase-derived key never had a file of its own; the keyring/keyfile master key
  (master.key) and the cached lockbox key (vault.key) are gone with the code that wrote them.
