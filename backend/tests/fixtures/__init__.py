"""Shared test fixtures (owned by WP2). Fake data only - nothing here was ever a real vault.

- `FakeSealBackend`: a stand-in for `systemd-creds --user` with a switchable TPM, so tests can
  seal, re-seal, pull the TPM and clear it without root or hardware.
- `vstore_env(tmp)`: points the v2 store at a scratch directory and installs a fake backend.
- `v1_files()`: the committed 1.x vault in `v1_vault/`, made by `make_v1_fixture.py` with the
  known test passphrase `V1_PASSPHRASE` and deliberately cheap Argon2id limits.
