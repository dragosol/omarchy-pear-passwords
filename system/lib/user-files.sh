# and how it tells a file Pear wrote from one you wrote. Sourced after system/paths.env.
#
# 1.x installed systemd user units and a launcher into your home. 2.0 replaces them, and
# removes one only if its bytes are exactly a version 1.x shipped (RELEASED_USER below). A file
# you edited, or one with the same name that is not Pear's, is listed and left alone. The
# launcher embeds your home directory, so it is compared with that one path replaced by
# @DATA@.
#
# Nothing here touches ~/.config/icp (the 1.x vault): the migration in the 2.0 window owns it.
