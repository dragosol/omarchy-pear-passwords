"""Report when fingers land on the touchpad, so the Passwords app can catch a coasting scroll.

Why this exists at all: resting fingers on a touchpad sends no scroll event until they move
past libinput's threshold. The signal for "fingers down, still" is the Wayland hold gesture
(zwp_pointer_gesture_hold_v1). Hyprland sends it; Qt 6.11's Wayland client never binds it -
it implements pinch and swipe only - so a Qt app is never told. GTK is, which is why a flick
can be caught in Zen and not here. This reads the one fact needed straight off the device.

Deliberately minimal, because it runs next to a password vault:
  * opens only the touchpad - a touchpad cannot carry keystrokes, the keyboard is another device
  * prints the single word `touch` on a finger landing; never a coordinate, never anything else
  * read-only, standard library only, exits when its parent (the app) goes away
If there is no readable touchpad it exits quietly and the app simply loses the catch.

Run with the system interpreter: it needs nothing from the icp venv.
