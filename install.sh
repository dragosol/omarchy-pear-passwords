#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Pear Passwords installer, the part that runs as you. It never uses sudo and refuses to run as
# root. 2.0 keeps your passwords in a small system service (pear-passwordsd, under its own
# user), so the install has two halves: this script, then one root command it prints at the end.
#
# What this script does:
#   - builds the anisette sign-in helper from pinned source and enables its user unit
#     (~/.config/systemd/user/pear-passwords-anisette.service), as 1.x did;
#   - stages what the root command installs into ~/.cache/pear-passwords/stage: exactly the
#     files SHA256SUMS lists, copied from this checkout, plus the hash-locked wheels
#     (downloaded with pip --require-hashes, wheels only). Root never downloads anything;
#   - retires what 1.x put in your home, file by file and only on an exact hash match
#     (system/lib/user-files.sh): the 2-hourly sync units, the 1.x launcher once the 2.0 one
#     exists, and the 1.x virtualenv once your passwords have moved into 2.0;
#   - prints the root command, with the hash of SHA256SUMS that you check against the release
#     notes. Nothing here runs anything as root.
# It never touches ~/.config/icp (your 1.x vault): the 2.0 window moves it, once, when you ask.
#
# No browser is set up for autofill. That is opt-in, per browser, with your own extension:
# `pear-passwords-autofill register` (README, "Autofill (bring your own extension)").
#
#   ./install.sh             everything above
#   ./install.sh --stage     only stage and print the root command (no anisette, no cleanup)
#   ./install.sh --app-only  only report whether the system part is installed and matches this
#                            checkout (exit 0), is missing (3) or is another version (4).
#                            Writes nothing except retiring hash-matched 1.x files once 2.0 is
#                            installed. (The plugin makes the same VERSION comparison itself,
#                            read-only, when the shell loads; it does not run this script.)
#
# Re-run it after `omarchy plugin update`, then run the root command it prints again.

$(root_command)

It copies the stage into a fresh directory under /root, checks it against this hash of
SHA256SUMS, and runs system/install-root.sh from that copy:

    $sums_hash

Check that the hash matches the one in the release notes for $version, at
https://github.com/dragosol/omarchy-pear-passwords/releases - it is what proves the files
root installs are the reviewed ones. Then open Pear Passwords from the launcher.

The 1.x launcher stays until the 2.0 one exists. After the root command, run
